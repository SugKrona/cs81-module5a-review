### What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?

This assignment was great for practicing how to read and understand code written by others. Explaining the lines of codes helped me truly understand how these programs are clear and efficient. It also taught me to think critically about how code is structured.

### What was the most confusing part?

I would say  understanding how the function that aggregates data worked would be the most confusing part. Figuring out exactly how the value accumulated across iterations required a lot of focus. Going over the code with the comments eventually made the whole thing much clearer.
